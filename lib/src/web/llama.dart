/// A class that isolates the Llama implementation to run in a separate isolate.

/// This class implements the [Llama] interface and provides methods to interact
/// with the Llama model in an isolated environment.
///
/// The [Llama] constructor initializes the isolate with the provided
/// model, context, and sampling parameters.
///
/// The [prompt] method sends a list of [ChatMessage] to the isolate and returns
/// a stream of responses. It waits for the isolate to be initialized before
/// sending the messages.
///
/// The [stop] method sends a signal to the isolate to stop processing. It waits
/// for the isolate to be initialized before sending the signal.
///
/// The [reload] method stops the current operation and reloads the isolate.
