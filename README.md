lcpp is a dart implementation of llama.cpp used by the mobile artificial intelligence distribution (maid)

## Features

- Optional use of isolations for parallel processing
- Streaming support

## Getting started

To use this package, add `lcpp` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

```yaml
dependencies:
  lcpp: ^0.2.6
```

then you can import llama in your Dart code

```dart
import 'package:lcpp/lcpp.dart';
```

## Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use llama

```dart
final llama = LlamaIsolated(LlamaParams(
  modelFile: File('path/to/model'),
  nCtx: 2048, 
  nBatch: 2048,
  greedy: true
));

final messages = [
  ChatMessage.withRole(role: 'user', content: 'Hello World'),
];

final stream = llama.prompt(messages);

stream.listen((event) {
  print(event);
});
```
